# Data 100 Projects (UC Berkeley)

This repository contains my coursework for **Data 100: Principles and Techniques of Data Science** at UC Berkeley.  
The projects focus on the full data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Solutions for UC Berkeley's Data 100 projects, featuring predictive modeling for bike-sharing demand and a logistic regression-based spam/ham email classifier.

    "## Introduction\n",
    "You will use what you've learned in class to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk, commercial, or bulk) emails from ham (regular non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this project, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data.\n",
    "- Using the `sklearn` library to process data and fit models.\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first part of the project focuses on initial analysis, feature engineering, and logistic regression. In the second part of this project (which will be released next week), you will build your own spam/ham classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Warning\n",
    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails but wanted to provide a warning at the beginning of the project so that you are aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you feel uncomfortable with this topic, **please contact your TA, the instructors, or reach out via the [Fall 2025 Additional Accommodations Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLQXhbxlbenjEkhbonBrd6XFiKoPXgq2B7VBvKwYbW9a49dA/viewform).**"

    "Create the bar chart above by comparing the proportion of spam and ham emails containing specific words. **Choose a set of 6 words other than those shown in the example.** These words should have different proportions for the two classes (i.e., noticeably different bar heights across spam and ham). Make sure only to consider emails from `train`. Your `words_in_texts` function from the previous part will be useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** This is a pretty challenging question. The suggested approach is to first look at the example bar plot and make sure you can interpret what is being plotted - what does a bar represent? What does the height mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, see how to make this plot with `sns.barplot`. Take a look at the [documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) and determine what the inputs should be. A possible data input is given below:\n",
    "<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">  <thead>    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">      <th></th>      <th>type</th>      <th>variable</th>      <th>value</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    \n",

    "</tbody></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will need to chain some `pandas` functions together. Try to add one function at a time and see how that affects the `DataFrame`. It may help to use a new cell or print out the `DataFrame` for debugging purposes as you work towards achieving the desired format above."

In future parts of this analysis, we will make use of the data we held out for model validation and comparison.\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

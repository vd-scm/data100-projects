    "- Using `sklearn` libraries to process data and fit classification models.\n",

    "- Generating and analyzing ROC curves.\n",

    "This is a **real-world** dataset —— the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails, but we wanted to warn you at the beginning of the project so that you are made aware.\n",

    "In our models, we evaluate the accuracy of the training set, which may provide a misleading accuracy measure. In Project B1, we calculated various metrics to consider other ways of evaluating a classifier, in addition to overall accuracy. Below is a reference for these concepts.\n",

    "- **False negative (FN)**: A spam email gets mislabeled as ham and ends up in the inbox.\n",

    "To be clear, we label spam emails as 1 and ham emails as 0. These definitions depend both on the true labels and the predicted labels. False positives and false negatives may be of differing importance, leading us to consider more ways of evaluating a classifier in addition to overall accuracy:\n",

    "With this in mind, it is now your task to make the spam filter more accurate. To get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **90%** accuracy on the train set and at least **85%** accuracy on the test set (see Question 3 for the partial credit breakdown). To determine your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` `DataFrame` and upload your predictions to Pensieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You will only be able to submit your test set predictions to Pensieve up to 4 times per day**. You will be able to see your accuracy on the entire test set when submitting to Pensieve. Note that attempts will not carry over across days, so we recommend planning ahead to make sure you have enough time to finetune your model! In the case that you are approved for an extension, you are granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for improving your model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding better features based on the email text. Some example features are:\n",
    "    1. Number of characters in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Number of words in the subject/body\n",
    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!'s were there?)\n",
    "    1. Number/percentage of capital letters \n",
    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. Alternatively, you can identify misclassified emails and see which relevant words are missing in your model.\n",
    "1. Reducing dimensionality and/or multicollinearity. There are a few methods to achieve this:\n",
    "    1. Interpret the model coefficients. Note that a feature will be more valuable in classification if its coefficient has a larger **absolute** value. If the coefficient has a lower **absolute** value, the feature likely isn't valuable in classifying emails.\n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust the parameters of your model (e.g. the penalty type, the regularization parameter, or any arguments in `LogisticRegression`) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation for feature and model selection! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",
    "    1. Consider implementing L1 regularization. The [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for `LogisticRegression` may be helpful here. \n",
    "    1. We have imported `GridSearchCV` for you. You may use sklearn's `GridSearchCV` ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)) class to perform cross-validation. You do not need to code cross-validation from scratch, though you are welcome to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use `GridSearchCV`. Suppose we wanted to experiment with 4 different solvers (numerical methods for optimizing the mode) models for a `LogisticRegression` model `lr_model`. \n",
    "1. We could define a dictionary specifying the hyperparameters and the specific values we want to try out like so: `parameters = {'solver':[{'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'newton-cg', 'saga']}`.\n",
    "2. Running `grid = GridSearchCV(estimator=lr_model, param_grid=parameters)` would give us a model for each combination of hyperparameters we are testing - in this case, just 4 models.\n",
    "3. We fit each model to some training data `X_train` and `Y_train` using `grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, Y_train)`.\n",
    "4. Indexing into `grid_result.cv_results_` with a particular metric (in this case, `mean_test_score`), we get an array with the scores corresponding to each of the models. `grid_result.cv_results_['mean_test_score']`.\n",
    "Feel free to experiment with other hyperparameters and metrics as well. The documentation is your friend!     \n",
    "       \n",
    "You may use whatever method you prefer to create features, but **you may only use the packages we've imported for you in the cell below or earlier in this notebook**. In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No decision trees, random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** You may want to use your **validation data** to evaluate your model and get a better sense of how it will perform on the test set. However, you may overfit to your validation set if you try to optimize your validation accuracy too much. Alternatively, you can perform cross-validation on the entire training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 2:** If you see a `ConvergenceWarning`, increase the maximum number of iterations the model runs for by passing in a parameter, `max_iter`, into `LogisticRegression()`. This should get rid of the warning. For a longer discussion on why this warning appears, you might find [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62658215/convergencewarning-lbfgs-failed-to-converge-status-1-stop-total-no-of-iter) helpful. Convergence of solvers is not in scope for Data 100, but by understanding what the error messages are saying, you can get some useful context on what to do in these situations."

In addition, **you are only allowed to train logistic regression models**. No decision trees, random forests, k-nearest-neighbors, neural nets, etc. \n",

In the case that you are approved for an extension, you are granted 4 more submissions for each day the deadline has been extended. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough time to fine-tune your model! The thresholds are as follows:\n",

Some of the generic words or numeric features decrease my training_accuracy, which means that adding more doesn't necessarily mean that it will reach the 90% threshold, and it can rather lower the accuracy. I also think that increasing iterations (max_iter) made it better to reach the accuracy. 3.) Im surprised by how much finding the actually correct features and words could significantly change or impact the accuracy, even with just a single word. It was also surprising how some words that I knew would increase training accuracy, in return, decreased my accuracy.

    "Below, you will see a cell. Running this cell will automatically generate a zip file with your autograded answers. Once you submit this file to the Project B2 Coding assignment on Pensieve, Pensieve will automatically submit a PDF file with your written answers to the Project B2 Written assignment. If you run into any issues when running this cell, feel free to check this [section](https://ds100.org/debugging-guide/autograder_gradescope/autograder_gradescope.html#why-does-grader.exportrun_teststrue-fail-if-all-previous-tests-passed) in the Data 100 Debugging Guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are issues with automatically generating the PDF, you can try downloading the notebook as a PDF by clicking on `File -> Save and Export Notebook As... -> PDF`. If that doesn't work either, you can manually take screenshots of your answers to the manually graded questions and submit those. \n",

    "\n",
    "* **Project B2 Coding:** Submit the zip file generated by using the `grader.export()` cell provided below.\n",
    "* **Project B2 Written:** Pensieve will automatically submit the PDF from the zip file submitted earlier. You do not need to submit anything to this assignment yourself, but *please check that the submission went through properly and that all plots rendered correctly*.\n",
    "* **Project B2 Test Set Predictions:** Submit the CSV file generated in `q3b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are responsible for ensuring your submission follows our requirements and that everything was generated and submitted correctly. We will not be granting regrade requests nor extensions to submissions that don't follow instructions.** If you encounter any difficulties with submission, please don't hesitate to reach out to staff prior to the deadline.
